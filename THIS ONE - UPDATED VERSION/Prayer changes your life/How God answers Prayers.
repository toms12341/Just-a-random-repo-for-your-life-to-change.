Hebrews 11 / Pray about it.

You can get thoughts from Satan, your own conscientiousness 


When a Prayer of PISTUO = NO DOUBT AND UNBELIEF (IT WILL HAPPEN) , FAITH (STRONG BELIEF) and ACTION [Pistuo definition]
Is prayed it is send to postman Pat (Metaphor)

It travels to heaven where God's Throne is.


If you pray out your mouth and finish your prayer in some variance you will get 1-3 thoughts saying 

THESE THOUGHTS FROM SATAN IN SOME VARIANCE OF THESE:

for example

1. GOD WILL NEVER ANSWER YOUR PRAYER (DOUBT AND UNBELIEF)
2. Why would god ever help you?
3. You will always be a Loser 


SATAN THE OPPONENT OF HUMANITY WILL TRY TO ATTACK YOUR PRAYER IN SOME WAY BECAUSE HE

HATES YOU.

Remember to test the spirit in 1 John 1 aka test the thought in 1 John 1

Overtime he can send negative thoughts or pride thoughts ( your the best in the world) 

To stall or cut down your seeking if you let that thought/s in.

If you let that thought in you let in a demon.

Then fear or a negative feeling (not a fruit of the spirit feeling)
punches you in the stomach to cut down your prayer or progress in seeking.

This never ends and this is war rejecting satans thoughts/spirits as explained in 1 john 1.


When you pray is always Hits heaven it is always answered in some way unless you let those negative thoughts in which create fear.

Once you have fear you do not have faith.

IF you have PISTUO you have no fear.
ELSE you have FEAR you have no pistuo. - Can recover it but when praying its important to not let the thought / spirit in. 



Try praying out of your mouth to test my teaching. (May be a trick instantly but is the usual strategy of satan).



Satan's spirits/Thoughts rejected and your Prayer that is prayed in Pistuo is passed satan's attack it is

Yes and AMEN.

This doesn't mean you have full control of how it is answered but is it is answered with God's superiority in Authority (God's way) 

to gain what you have ASKED GOD FOR from your prayer. 

If you pray for that BMW green car - Doesn't mean you will get a fast Green car exactly as you think it to be 

but God will say:

I will give you a green fast affordable car but just go down to the wreckers and repair that car for example. 

And it be the best fast green car you will have with no problems for life but answered God's way. 

(God gives more than you ask for)
