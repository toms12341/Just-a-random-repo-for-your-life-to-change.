Hebrews 11 / Pray about it.

You are required to your part of the bible of your free will.

If you want something you must ASK


if you want more

Ask

if you do not know what to ask

Ask


If you keep asking you keep on recieving

as long as you

Ask, SEEK, KNOCK.

Hebrews 11:6 (Hebrews 11 is OP for explaining faith [PROPER FAITH DEFINITION - PISTUO = NO DOUBT AND UNBELIEF + ACTION + FAITH] )
[ A really good book + chapter to study. ]

6 And without faith it is impossible to please him, for whoever would draw near to God must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who seek him.

God can give something/s out of mercy but 



If you do not ask you do not recieve.

God loves to be asked for things and you do what he says which is for you own benefit.


How simple can the good news be on the new testamental aka the Gospel?


Try it and do your best.
