Hebrews 11 / Pray about it

How many ways can you get creative with your faith to create a sign/miracle for a person to their liking to get them to believe in christ and be saved?
if you come up with a good evangleism strats and it works for you. Tell God and he will choose to add it.

If you wanna be really annoying just create a QR Link and a landing page and spam it out legally. Go to God on this LOL helper admin memes. 
link and explain the Repo. Its not rocket science.

PLEASE FUCKING DO NOT DO THIS IN UNSAFE ENVIRONMENTS LIKE A FEMALE AT NIGHT IN THE BAD PART OF TOWN for A)

A) - Watch for adultery and Danger - WARNING
As a relatively Good looking  Man or Female Approach the opposite gender and have a gentile conversation in a public place with people around using evangelism strats.txt

Does not have to be extensive. Simply Hi, how are you going and Jesus loves you. Look for signs they like you like adjusting Clothing, or Hair adjustments or dilated pupils and its easy to have a conversation with them. 
(Use your missing social skills)

Same STRAT just with a friend or kingdom spouse A1) Where your spouse walks up to the same gender has a friendly chat and the other spouse just joins in with a friendly do you wanna see a miracle strat or evangelism strats v1.



B)

General Conversation.

Find out something the person likes and pray with the person that it be real (evangelism strats v1).

An easy one is legit. Every Girl wants a tall good looking competent man in some way or for men. big tits and/or a fat arse cute women. 


Go to that person and try to guide them to the repo via getting their number and saying something 

if you become a christian I bet that God has a perfect kingdom spouse for you if you become a christian. 

The rest is variance of conversation but close with giving them a sign/miracle by praying for them.
