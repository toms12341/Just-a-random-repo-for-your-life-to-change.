Hebrews 11 / Pray about it




A good sign you are picked for Evangelism.


1. Extroverted and easy going for having a chat in confidence.
2. Love beign a in a social environment.
3. Know how to talk or flirt with people naturally - charismatic (defined = exercising a compelling charm which inspires devotion in others.)
4. Natural leaders or strong in communication skills naturally (God will have to kick that shyness out if he picks this one for you ;) )


5. You can and will do a miracle no matter what in public.



Perfected to be a Evangelist. Just because it doesn't fit your mold and God says for you to do this ministry/responsibility he means


that


You are for this ministry. Enjoy it. Its quite fun. I go round town with a stupid voice making people laugh walking off not fucking caring at all....

For example
Saying you look Good my Friend in my old retarded voice and then saying Jesus loves you. 
They just laugh and dont actually give a shit + they normally enjoy it.


No one who is brand new to a topic is ever an expert and willing to talk for hours on Christianity. Especially pre-saved people. 


They have no understanding of manifestations that are demons fearing holy spirit causing that person to be blocked or hindered from being evangelised to.

Does it look like i give a flying fuck what demons do. Not at all just adjust and use your weapons / authority in christ by praying against the spirits.

I sowed the seed. God yields the increase aka watering the crop to change for christ.

Evangelists are gaining multitude of sins covered by evangelising
