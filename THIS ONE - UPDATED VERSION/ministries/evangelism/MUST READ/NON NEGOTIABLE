Hebrews 11 / Pray about it

i prayed for you anyway but this is warfare doing this.

USE YOUR SPIRITUAL GIFTS OF DISCERNMENT OR JUDGEMENT WITH HOLY SPIRIT GUIDANCE - FFS PLEASE FUCKING PRAY ABOUT IT BEFORE YOU EVEN START EVANGELISM. 1 JOHN 1 AND/OR TRANSLATION WITH TOUNGES

I CANNOT STRESS THAT ENOUGH. PLEASE FUCKING PRAY ABOUT IT BEFORE YOU EVEN START EVANGELISM. 1JOHN 1 OR TRANSLATION WITH TOUNGES.

Common sense must prevail.

for example

if you are a female please do not go out at night to a specific shitty area of the city known for crime and do evanglism. Thats fucking stupid God forbid this, for real.

if you are male and solo avoid the drug parts of the city.

Best to do this in public places. Yes you can be attacked by people due to witchcraft spirits, spirts of murder, spirits of wrath, spirits of abuse, and more as they work together. 



Can be done not as a ministry but as a gift.

ONCE IN MINISTRY -  BE CAREFUL AS SOME PEOPLE ARE NOT WANTED TO BE EVANGELISED TO BUT JUST NEED SOME LOVE.



FOR A -10 PERSON JUST GIVE THEM A SMILE OR COMPLIMENT 

Evanglists - IT IS NOT YOUR JOB TO FIX THE PERSON. THAT'S ABOVE YOUR PAY GRADE. THIS IS EXCLUDING IF THEY ARE INTERESTED AND ACCEPTING OF A MIRACLE

1. Pray to God about gaining an Assignment for EVANGELISM. IF ON THE GO LISTEN TO THE HOLY SPIRIT / your consciousness please. 
1a) Pray for the people or persons who you will EVANGELISE to before you go out.

Example ministry prayer.

Jesus thank you father god and praise you I pray you bring me people who are not time wasters, 
you provide their needs whilst i show them the work of your hands. Let them know a miracle and that you help me evangelise for your glory.
i pray wisdom where its required and the best action to take in every scenario with safety applied.
Amen


Before approach. Pray against their spirits by going

ty father god in jesus name, demons you will not hinder or block what I will do here 

1b) Ask Holy spirit to train you on how to do EVANGELISM. Holy spirit in some way will highlight or draw to your eye someone he wants you to talk to.



2. Check with God if he wants this or that person to be EVANGELISED TO.

2a) Please pray for holy spirit to teach you about the SCALE of people. 

SCALE example -10 \ \ \ \  \ \ \ \ 0 \ \ \ \ \ \ +10


-10 People are cold as fuck and need love to be warmed up by being nice to them.
0 People are in the middle and 50/50 interaction.
+10 People are hardcore christians who read the people every day



3) Go out with 2 members at all times to support you doing evanglism ideally based on acts. 


Be careful as demons are STEAL KILL AND DESTROY.


Have a go. Just try your best its whatever you can do have a go and try. TRY your best.

Just because its not your ministry doesnt mean you cannot use your talents.


Father God asks that you have an attempt no matter how hard it is. Any attempt is loved by God.

Try again til you become comfortable with people. You can and will succeed in time doing this with repetition.
