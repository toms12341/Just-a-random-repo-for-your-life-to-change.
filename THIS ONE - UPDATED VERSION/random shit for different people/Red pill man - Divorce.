Divorce sucks.. Hebrews 11. Pray about Marriage. It's way better than adultery and whoredom. Whoredom makes you feel worthless and hate either/or genders.


I fucking hate it.



It ruins families and finances.

lack of $$$ is a leading cause of it.


If you hate the marriage rules legally.


You can get married spiritually and make a spiritual contract with god or a prenup.


Because for breadwinners its dogshit.

Pray about it.
