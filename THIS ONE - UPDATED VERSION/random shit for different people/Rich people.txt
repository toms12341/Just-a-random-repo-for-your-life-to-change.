I get it you made a business and didn't like getting the hourly wage.

 IMPORANT ASF - I can be wrong - Hebrews 11 - Holy spirit is your best teacher.


There's a lie that your going to hell for being rich

Ethnically business practices are preferred by god. Free market is the best market.


Abraham was rich? There's a wealth blessing of Abraham

Pslam 50:10

for every animal of the forest is mine, and the cattle on a thousand hills.


That's God's wealth. God - Jesus owns the world but wants you to choose him because he loves you and wants you to love him back?


IDK lol just god and God is love. Life is as it is and I cannot change rules of the bible.




“No man can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other,
or else he will hold to the one and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.



You either need God or money in life. What do you choose to be your security and place of I need help.


Ok. Its your relationship with God not about if you have money you're going to HELL.

Have a better relationship with God than your money and PRAY ABOUT THIS TRUTH

Alot of wealthier people are not happy because they had to prove themselves to be where they are or they just liked the freedom of wealth like most dream and did something about it.


Sure some got it in other ways but I couldn't care less unless you gave it to me..... 

People can be fake etc but god can get you some good people even if you are a rich person as you know ;)
