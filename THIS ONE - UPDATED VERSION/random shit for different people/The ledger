Hebrews 11
Well. Pray how to use a ledger. 


People are not normally good. They fall short and all are wicked in some way.


It's an accounting term a ledger.


-5 0 and +5 

It's what I have?

So if someone does a good thing you go + 1. You can go +5 but let god give you the wisdom.

If someone does something bad -1 The ledger is infitnite on the positive.



Sure they can fuck it from 10k like your wife tells you you smell and lose 5k point for example.



For men a wife cheating even if shes at 50k and cheats = - 5 same with women in some way.


some one gives a car thats like +50k


Too many cunts are giving love is tolerance.


Love is not tolerance.

Love is what you should pray for on the right meanings.



Love doesn't let someone go to the shitter for not telling them the truth for example.


Pray for a correct way to love someone and remove bad people from your life as.

You don't need all these bad people ruining your life.
