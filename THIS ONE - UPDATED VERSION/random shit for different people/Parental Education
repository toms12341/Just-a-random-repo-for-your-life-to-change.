Hebrews 11 / Pray about it.



The standard you must go to university shit is fucking garbage as fuck.

You must educate your children more than the school system is proverb of mine. 


Change your mind and do the research on what you are saying to your children who are on path or near to go to university.

If you send them to university and they do not know what they want to do in life.

You send them in debt with a university loan.


Not all degrees are equal.


Can that stigma fuck off honestly.

You must go to university?


Trades do great money if you did the maths.
You can be a great graphic designer with university.
You can be a software developer with a bootcamp or code academy with a porfolio.



It is important to educate your child from your side and where they want to go.

But sending them into debt for a degree with no job on the back end of it is

STUPID AS FUCK.

They're not a failure if they pick up a customer service job and sit on it for 4 years and invest their $ money 

WHEN

MATHS = They're way richer than those who chose debt.

Talk to God with tounges and transaltion about this rant.

Thank you

Peace out to you and please forgive me.
