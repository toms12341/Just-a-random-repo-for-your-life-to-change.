Here you go. (Do not stay with abusers or you can get sick)


fk it. Shut up about half a verse of scripture LOL.


 Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right. 2 “Honor your father and mother” (this is the first commandment with a promise), 3 “that it may go well with you and that you may live long in the land.” 

CHILDREN:

Do not curse your parents as that is dishonouring your parents.

4 Fathers (IT INCLUDES MOTHERS IDGAF), do not provoke your children to anger, but bring them up in the discipline and instruction of the Lord.


I do not as a kid need to listen to an abuser. EVER.


Just do not curse them and pray about it.

Leave them, pray the ought out. Give them to God. NOT MY PROBLEM for The kids or parents. God can deal with their shit. 

CHILDREN -Do not stay with an abuser who will not change (Do not stay or you can get sick)

Psalm 27:10 When my father and my mother forsake me, then the Lord will take me up.



fk off with you must obey when you cannot see you may be abusive.

Parents with kids who are harder to look after.
