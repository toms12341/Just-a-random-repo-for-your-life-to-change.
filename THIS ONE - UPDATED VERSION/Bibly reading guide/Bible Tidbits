Hebrews 11 / Pray about it.

When Doing the word you get a blessing and an incentive to continue doing the word.

There is always a gain when you do the word of God. This is God showing you that he loves what you're doing when doing the word. <3


Rev. Elton / Wigglesworth.

When you read the word it's extremely powerful and will change your entire consciouness based on what holy spirit works into and thru you.

It's a miracle in itself upon the Glory of God what you life becomes via doing and reading the word.



1. 

Always read the bible outloud when you are reading it.


Don't Just read it 

DO IT.

If you are audiobibling and something is clearer heard than another passage 


Holy spirit is showing you what he wants you do it more than the other parts at your current journey.


If something in the bible is highlighted as you read - Holy spirit wants you to read that part of the bible.

3. From Mt. Caramel aka Win Worley.

If you do not understand the bible keep reading it and it will be revealed later.  

4. Have a blank peace of paper or use your finger to draw along with where you are reading.
