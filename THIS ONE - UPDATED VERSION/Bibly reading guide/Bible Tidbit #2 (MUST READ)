Hebrews 11 / Pray about it.


IN tounges and translation from Father God.

I love you all to attempt reading the bible and anything you do for Christ as long as it's commanded by me in 1 john 1 and meets my word.

Thank you - Talk to me in Tounges When you read this




1. Read the bible story in context to what is occuring per the parable.

2. It is a jigsaw puzzle to complete all the pieces to have more of a knowledge and actionable wisdom base of the bible. 

2b) It is powerful the bible but it is God's choice on what wisdom you are ready be given to recieve as you're being training via holy spirit / Hebrews 11 via the word.

2c) Read the parable and think of the context of who is talking to Jesus and Jesus talking to the Crowd.

3) Read the parable or riddle aka story with a meaning behind it and discern the meaning thereof with holy spirit.

3b) Meditate/think on what is written per the word and do not be legalistic as taught per repo. 


Even a paraphrased verse is powerful.

Fear not -  for example words against fear but 


do not teach it without disclosure // keep in context with paraphrasing. 


I love all your attempts to try to read the bible. 

In christ ty father and praise you. I bless their baseplates of christianity.
This is to do with reading the bible and their prayer lives.
Let them Grow from Milk to Meat as you require to build a stronger body.
Let the world be changed by their actions and let them realise their potential to reality in christ.

Thank you father for your helping hand to your church

Amen.

Father himself loves you  (In context talking to the followers aka disciples of christ) (paraphrased)
