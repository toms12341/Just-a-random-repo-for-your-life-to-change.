Hebrews 11 / Pray about it


Pray before reading the bible.

God would love you to ask what he wants to teach you in the bible by tounges + translation.

You are the clay and the student with the bible to holy spirit molding you and teaching you for greater things.

If you do not understand a topic on the bible.



It's as simple as 


IN jesus Ty and Bless you father Help me with this topic.


For example.



IN jesus Ty and Bless you father Help me with Parable of the Talents.


Father WITH ZERO DOUBT IN MY OWN MIND WOULD 


LOVE YOU UPON LOVE YOU TO DO HIS WORD as John 14.


if you ask him to help you with the bible by praying because doing the word of God shows love to father.

If you mess it up because of the works of the flesh God will forgive you but 

if you over do sin you can go to judgement unless you have a multitude of sins convered (james 1)
