Hebrews 11 / Pray about it.




This one is an answer to 

I do not know what to pray bullshit. 


1. Ask Holy spirit to help you pray.
1b) Word of Knowledge activates when you speak and then the prayer you need get prayed via word of knowledge.

Remember to reject those 2 negatives thoughts after it.



2. Select a topic you wanna pray about and go like so.


I want to pray about (TOPIC) example - (MARRIAGE for kindgom spouse)


 Pray your holy tounges + translation

and your prayer was prayed perfectly by your helper/comforter.
