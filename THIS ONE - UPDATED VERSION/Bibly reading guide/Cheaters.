If they had previous partners cheating.

You could have had an STI.


If they cheated and god says so and you had an STI.


Forgive them and pray for them.


It's their choice and you can divorce them.



You can leave abusers if god says so and remarry.


1 John 1 jesus christ is come in the flesh.
Dont be angry at me for your choice and its mainly the young people who are cheating who are single.

Pray about sexual immorality in your lives and quit it. See sex.txt
