Become who you want to be not what you are.



Philippians 3:13

13 Brethren, I do not count myself to have [a]apprehended; but one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forward to those things which are ahead,


Do not look back at the past. But when going through deliverance remember how good has been since that horrific day or past. Live for today


Today and this moment is all you have. Love life and do what makes your definition of success become reality. Its hard being mentally ill and getting stolen from bad people and shit..



Restoration is nigh. DO SMI LIST AND FIGHT - YOU CAN DO THIS.


Look to what you want and if you do not know PRAY IN MERCY FOR ANYTHING TO HOPE FOR AND TO GO TOWARDS YOUR IDEAL LIFE WITHOUT SIN IN CHRIST.


NO MATTER IF IT FEELS BAD.


Your past is the sum of where you are today and today is when your choice to make your future.

The future one day is the past. The past once was the present. The present is the steerer of your life with your choices.
