Hebrews 11 - Pray about this one 


NEVER LET ANYONE WHO LAY HANDS ON YOU EVER.
If you are fully delivered and confirmed with 1 john 1 you can lay hands but 
Let holy spirit tell you when to do it and test the spirit in 1 john 1.



Do not lay hands like holding hands or on your body ever.


Do not be afraid if they do.


Just do not agree to their prayer if they do it and it will not have

You feeling werid

or a copy of some of their demons or feeling bad after it.



Peter picking up someone did laying of hands in the gate story. That's the biblical way.
