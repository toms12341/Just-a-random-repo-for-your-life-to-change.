Hebrews 11 - Pray about this one 

Do not lay hands like holding hands or on your body ever.


Do not be afraid if they do.


Just do not agree to their prayer if they do it and it will not have

You feeling werid

or a copy of some of their demons or feeling bad after it.



Peter picking up someone did laying of hands in the gate story. That's the biblical way.
