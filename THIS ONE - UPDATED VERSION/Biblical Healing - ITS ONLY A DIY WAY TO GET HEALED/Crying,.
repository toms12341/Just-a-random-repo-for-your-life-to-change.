Hebrews 11


if you cannot cry ask god to cry. 

You are not a pussy for crying.


Sometimes its healthy. Sometimes you just need to toughen up.



Give yourself permission to cry so you heal quicker.



Also. Its a good sign God loves you.


Eat a good meal. Do something you like after and praise god.
