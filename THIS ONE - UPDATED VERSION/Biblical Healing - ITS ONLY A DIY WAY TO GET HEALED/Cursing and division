HEBREWS 11: Pray about it

READ IT ALL DO NOT HALF READ THIS
YOU MUST PRAY ABOUT CURSING. ITS VERY SPECIFIC AND GOD DOESNT WANT YOU TO CURSE PEOPLE.
JUST REMEMBER BLESSED WHEN CURSED AND PRAY WHEN PERSEUCTED OVERALL. #1 RULE.


You can curse. 

I know. It's only for specific things. Its like not witchcraft prayer but say its God's choice.


LISTEN HERE.


If you have gun pointed at you. CURSE THE GUN NO MATTER WHAT IT WILL WORK UNDER MERCY.
If you have knife pointed at you. CURSE THE knife NO MATTER WHAT IT WILL WORK UNDER MERCY.

DISCLAIMER.

DO NOT LOOSE THIS IN LOVING SITUATIONS AND PLACES WHERE YOU ARE NOT GUIDED BY HOLY SPIRIT ON THIS OR FEEL DANGER LIKE GETTING MURDERED.

You can loose division on your enemimes from coming near you.


God hates division but when needed from like old you to new you god likes it.

SPECIFICALLY LIKE THIS:  PROTECTION ONLY

I like cursing when its dangerous with a knife but not when they yell at me with a curse. They knife will fall and you can get them with violice under protection.
Curse the item like gun when in danger.
Loose division against you from your enemies if they're coming for you. - PROTECTION ONLY
