If you backslide you can repent again.




Break all curses, be sorry for your sin and ask for help to change to turn from sin.

Cast it out again.


if you cannot repent or turn from your sin you will not be delivered of that sin til you repent of it but others sins or demons will come out.


sin = satan = demons.
