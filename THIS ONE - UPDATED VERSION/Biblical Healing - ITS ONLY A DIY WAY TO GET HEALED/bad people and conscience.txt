Hebrews 11- pray about


Usually.


Bad people


I dont think you know.


Your conscience i mean, conscious flairs when there is some that you shouldn't do, be near or there's a person about to hurt you.


It's like a test showing a terminal for debug that you have to fix.



Or a red flag that you can feel. May be a thought from God. Going. GTFO.



SO it feels like this when there's a conscious fair or GTFO feeling about something.

Its like a gut feeling.


fk LISTEN YOU IDIOT, sincerely  FROM YOU conscious.

Get out faster than man in horror movie because. They know whats up in those movies right?



It's a werid dark and cold heavy feeling that you go.


Nah.


I do not like this feeling.

Ask god for the example of it.


Pray bout it .
