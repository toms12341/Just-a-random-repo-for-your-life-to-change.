All negative feelings are demonic if you have no reason for them to be there.




You can be sad normally. Guilt and hopelessness, suicide and despair.

Guilt feels like weight that i did wrong.
Hopelessness nothing changes ever.
Suicide its like a scratchy feeling and i do not want to live (Anything that rolls the eyes up is death, suicide and murder - Pigs of parolour frank hammmond / ida mae
despair - Lost a sea with no way to escape.


Cast out bad feelings. You feel werid in anyway or whatever cast it out and test the spirit. Good feelings of holy spirit are peace, love, joy, hope etc.

Loose those feelings on you in pistuo.
