hebrews 11

 
be sorry for your sins.

You are forgiven but god hates sin 

GOd is a jealous god. Picking sin = picking satan and the flesh is weak to sin. Its fine under grace (have a multitude of sins covered) but hate sin.

Do not insult the spirit of grace. 

just weep it out. Repent and realise who loves you.\

Jesus. NOt Satan.
