You don't know what he has stolen, killed or destroyed. Steal, kill and destroy = SATAN THE ENEMY OF HUMANITY John 10:10
For example. If you have chronic fatigue. He has stolen your energy. Killed your mood. Destroyed your happiness later in the day.


If you cannot fight call for mercy and ask for righteous hatred of sin.
