Hebrews 11 - Pray about it.
John 1. 
John 14:15If you love me keep my commandments (do what jesus says.)
The bible is reality and the fabric of consciousness. 
The bible is the only book when you try any concept of it in it changes your life for your benefit.
Try speaking good things like for your stomach is strong
My face is good looking.

Affirmations are ok like proclaimations but do not fix things like deliverance.
Law of attraction is dogshit. This is just words.

DO NOT DO LAW OF ATTRACTION.



spoke the world into existence - Words are powerful and life changing. pray your complaints. Do not die like the JEWS in the desert in OT. 

A curse without a cause cannot a light and bless those that curse you.

Release your cares to god on complaints.


The logos word is Jesus Christ.


Everything in the world that is, is Jesus Christ.


Your consciousness is mirrored upon Jesus christ except when you allow sin in the door by your choices.


When you choose sin you choose satan. Which makes you have the charactistics of Satan.


GO through delievered from the pain and agony you did not have to suffer in hell due to the cross of christ.

Repent and turn from sin best you can/


Grace is not infinite. It's hard to lose but do not do millions of sins without multitude of sins. Do not make a habit of sin down the ditch.

Its hard to climb up to 0 from level 100.

most people about 11 on average.

Super sin is different.
