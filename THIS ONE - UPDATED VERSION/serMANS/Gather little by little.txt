Hebrews 11 - Pray about it. DO NOT DO THE LAW OF ATTRACTION.


Based on Jim Rohn's stuff but discern the difference where it not from the bible or apply the biblical solution of this.
His law of attraction is not actually the law of attraction. - OCCULT DOC (TBA

Prov. 13, 11. Wealth gained quickly will dwindle,
but whoever gathers little by little will increase it.


Define Wealth: A plentiful supply of a particular desirable thing.



Well. Baby steps till your walking. This is a proverb that if you can figure it out you'll be amazed. 



Start with what you have. No matter how small. People set goals at the highest peak and crumble at how high the mark is to climb that mountain.


Why would you bother setting goals you do not achieve? Have you ever pondered how to achieve these goals from your pinnacle?


You set a point then you must act on your goal?


Why bother live life average? Average Sucks. (Look at the teaching, Measurements or Standards on Human beings- TBA)

If you have one $1 and on average per month you gain 10%. (how2math101)


lets just add +0.1 to start. 

Jan - 1.1
Fed 1.2
Mar 1.3
April 1.4

It just increases slowly. But it does increase



I think the real math is something like ....

Jan - 1.11
Fed - 2.22
Mar 3.34
April 4.8



The progression of any choice of wealth is hard at the start but doesn't as you become better at acquiring wealth become easier, faster and your competency become better?


Be slowly growing your wealth to reach that goal but make sure you take an increment of being the tortoise from the story of old.


The rabbit and the other animals were fast of the starting line and got tired but the tortoise slowly walked all the way and finished the race.

You're surely not an idiot.
