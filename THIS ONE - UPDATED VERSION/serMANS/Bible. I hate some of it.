Well.

I try to do the bible the best i can but not fufuilling the law like jesus. Grace for me and you :)

I do not agree with everything in the bibie like ancestral sins. (ancestors who sinned and I dont get a fresh start or a clean state.)

I hate hell. Why? Adam.


You are never equal as a human being.
You are only equal under the biblical standards that do not change under God's method.


You have to choose your life to be better? C

Choose wisely but how?

So?



Create your life and Create the opportunity in your life as that's the playing field. Your hand from the dealer of parental, friends etc and your choices.

Your life is your life - charles bukowski. illneas is nice tho yt tidbit


We do not start with the same parents.
Same skills or traits or qualities given by god.
DO not have same job pay\
Do not have the same money in the bank. Musk to customer service worker.

The truth is.

Women. Do not be men as you can never be men. Your definition of success is different to a mans.
Women. Be Mothers, loving and caring. IDGAF MANSPLAINER 
nothing wrong with being a women.
Men. Be warriors. Be the leaders. You do not act like women or be them. It's okay to cry sometimes. Attitude counts.


You do not start off the same. So make your abilities the best you can to create your opportiunities and live up to what you dream. Not that bullshit of dreaming but living it as soon. My internal world which if you did deliverance has changed. Mine shall soon.

Equal opportunity doesn't exist either. You make your life what you do how you choose and make opportunities.
