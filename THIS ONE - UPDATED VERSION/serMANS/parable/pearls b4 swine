6 â€œDo not give what is holy to the dogs; nor cast your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn and tear you in pieces.



What is holy to the dogs or cast your pearls before swine?

It can be wisdom, helping hands things that you have to offer other people.


Pigs/dogs are bad people or people who choose to not value what you offer.

Just the analogy of the bible but they can behave like shit.


The take from you and tear you in pieces for what you gave.

When were you betrayed?

Because thats like this parable.
