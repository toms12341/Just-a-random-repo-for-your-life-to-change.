I never knew you from jesus?

Why would I bother being a Christian if i will go to hell for this?

21 “Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven. 22 Many will say to me on that day, ‘Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name and in your name drive out demons and in your name perform many miracles?’ 23 Then I will tell them plainly, ‘I never knew you. Away from me, you evildoers!’



It's simple like so.



You go to heaven based on what Jesus did for you at the cross but you have a responsibility to do the word best you can under grace.


There is nothing wrong with doing the work or will of the father (bible or thoughts he sends to you. If you disobey the thought unless its (DO NOT SIN LIKE SO) its not going to kill you. Just disobeying isn't for your own good. Ask for wisdom if you do not understand.


Watch for being exalted in pride and knowning your works got you to heaven when you will never make it

under your righteousness or works.


Perfect from within with holy spirit. Not yourself. - Perfection under the law.


Will go into this later.
