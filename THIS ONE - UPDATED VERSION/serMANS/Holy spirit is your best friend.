Hebrews 11 Pray about it.



I love you very much and I am a clone / similar to jesus.

I am your helper and source of comfort.

Reading the bible or audiobibling it gives you your comfort.


Try it. ASAP.

feeling bad.

Talk to Jesus.
Read the bible or listen to it.


Pray about the problem.

Anything where you go - GOD GIVE ME MERCY AND HELP I WILL ALWAYS ANSWER NO MATTER WHAT.

God is Love - Jesus is unconditional love. It is Just god is love.


I love you as you are but not the sin that you do. I hate it but I have grace for you.

Not infinite sins are forgiven til you forgive others and release ought - our father prayer is an example.


You can lose holy spirit for serious sins over many years like being a pedofile for 1 year for example.

Do not make that happen and listen to those good thoughts and do not backslide its only temporary those trials in james.


Trials can be called off if you pray for it.

WHEN YOU GET HARD TIMES PRAISE THROUGH IT AND PRAY THROUGH IT. Your blessing is near as fuck. Like super close. 

Enjoy that satan did not steal it. He always tries to steal it.


I never give you more than you can handle. I love you - From Jesus Christ.


More than a conqueror in christ. YOu can overcome these issues and I will never leave you for just 1 sin. You're not under law and gone to sheol. 

You are forgiven easily if you do what i say and forgive others / ought.


I want you to live to my rules which shows loves to I, Jesus christ in John 14.



I interpreted / translated all this in tounges. I had the idea - Gitguy

Holy spirit told me what to write like the bible.

DO this for your work or any decisisons. Anything.

Sex.
Work.
Investing.
Kids health or future. Or yours (Pray for everything now. NOW, do it? What are you waiting for. Change your life with 1 prayer as taught here. You will get your prayer always if you pray as taught on repo. Instantly answered but to manifest takes time. I am working on your prayer be patient. Talk to me about it in translation and tounges.) I love you so much - Jesus.


Don't make me cry at how you prayed and did nothing for it to become real. DO it.

DO IT. DO IT. SEEK AND KNOCK NOT JUST ASK.




Where is my life going? Jesus knows and can see the future. Talk about it and DO NOT be scared to ASK. Pray in tounges and translation. 


Never Fear. Cast it out. Get out of my Body. GET OF out of my House. Your body is a temple or house of God now.


Everyone. Proclaim or say. Father Himself Loves you. Do one of these a day. Try it. It changes your life.

Try this one if you think your a loser. 

in god we shall do valiantly.

Try this one if you do not like your body or face.

Fearfully and wonderfully made.

Try these 2 if you do not like being in fear or anxiety

Fear not.
Do not be anxious.

Just say stop that in jesus name or fuck off in faith and it will work.

Simple not over complicated and its just a bit of YOU start it and


I always answer my word.


Never shall it fail.


IF it doesn't go the way you know it.

Ask and do not take an offense. (Not forgiving yourself, god or people its not because i feel bad. Ask God in Tounges.)

Stupour = fabricated story or delusion. 



Jesus will Never ever ever never never. Did you get the point?


Never will abandon you.

You must fight with Eph 6 or your authority in Christ. Like Go away in Jesus christ. 


Do not fear satan. Pslam 91 is about where satan is. The lion and adder = Satan. 

Satan is only as scary as the fear he gives you. Use your weapons the sword. The BIBLE.

Anything that is in the bible is sharp and scares the living out of the demons and they manifest

Where is he under you?

Joshua 1:9 - Jehovah talking to Joshua (Jesus christ Old testament name of Jesus) If Jesus fought through the land in Joshua and is with you as holy wind (holy spirit) You have the power of God and God is not weak. 

Read this CLEARLY. Where - (Disclaimer)
You have every authority and power of God. You are an extention of God. You submit under god always. You cannot beat the word of god / rules of the bible. 

(Disclaimer) I am not God but God does the part of his word always. So when you use your authority know that your God is not weak. He does every miracle you can dream and use Pistuo. Heal anything. Just fucking do it.

I can do everything God can do because he is within me. I am as powerful as God In pistuo. 
God and I are one. My spirit is Big as fuck. Use your authority to grow your anointing.

God isnt an ant you squish. God is the I got the nuke of a century that life will cease to exist or the worlds strongest, good looking man with a heat seeking missle (Does not idenitify as an apache helicopter ok)

So Fight with the Strength of God and that you will fucking rkt (wreck) everything. God isn't perfect but his word is perfect. (Pray about it - Witcraft lie)
God isn't incompentant and always fufills his word.

HE DOES WHAT HE SAYS AND THE BIBLE IS THE SWORD THAT ALWAYS HURTS AND HE 

NEVER EVER

DOES NOT 

DO

HIS WORD.

Jesus Loves you and will fight for you, comfort you aswell as Have a conversation with you. Use tounges and Interpretation / translation. (Just ask and do not feel bad about asking)

OVER COME NOT ASKING FOR THINGS. DO IT PLEASE FROM JESUS - Tounges and translation. 




Fear not and do not be dismayed for the lord your god is with you wherever you go.


Fear not and do not be dismayed (Do not cowar or be super scared to the point where you want to run [Like in a fight you will lose.] You never lose to satan if you fight.)

You're royalty being christians and look how good peoples lives are who do the word and had minimal sin?


They did amazing. I love you so much. I know you do not feel or thinkg you're worth it it.


I love every flaw and failure of you. You failed to fufill the law but I love you to
Succeed under grace.


I give miracles to show i love you and things you do not know I work on and give you to make your life amazing.


I love, love. I am love. Jesus is unconditional love. Its my being and who I am. - Jesus. Interpretation and Tounges.


Father himself loves you .


DO THE WORD. DO THE WORD. DO THE WORD.

Please talk to me about your life.

NOW. 

I want to help you always.

Thanks for trying to do what you have done thus far.

I want you to be my precious and beautiful daughter with no pain or ugliness.
I want you to be my strong and handsome son with no poverty or divorce.


I hate these things in the world. Try to do anything I say and your life gets better.


I bet you a big blessing I know you like if you give it a go.

Jesus wants you to do the word.

Do it.

ITs make everything better.

From Jesus and Gitguy. Gitguy who did the work to write it and asked to do this line of work. So ask and I forgot to mention God tests you ;) Thought it be fun - Gitguy HAHA.

And Jesus checked the work and wrote things via holy spirit telling me what to write in the text doc.

That's how the bible was written.


tounges and translation via the Gift of God. Paul and Holy spirit wrote it like so. Paul Did the physical writing.

Understand?


Aren't you all amazing and can be so much more in christ.

Ask for how good you are and what your future can look like in your Inheritence (Like your Dream house, Kids or Husband/wife).
