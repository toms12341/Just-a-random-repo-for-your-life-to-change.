When you are holding a rope to a boat do not let it be slack lest a wave come and tare the rope from your hands.




You are in the control of what you hold. 



Do you control your life the way you want.


What matters?


What you control.


If not God takes care of it and you Pray it to change.



Focus on your own ability to control your life.
Focus singularly overtime leads to success
