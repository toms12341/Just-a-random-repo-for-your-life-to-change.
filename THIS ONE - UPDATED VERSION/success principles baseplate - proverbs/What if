What if 


I was stronger.
I was happier.
I was all i could be.


What if i actually become what i wanted to be without the shit of "Do what makes you happy or follow your heart"


No.


Fk what if.

Most people do not actually become what if because?

They do not try nor attempt their goals?

No. They do not "Persevere". They did not choose to attain nor did really want to live the life they dreamed.


How does life change.
Do it.

Wisdom is justified by her children.

God will help you.
God loves you.
