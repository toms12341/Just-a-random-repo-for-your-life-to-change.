mat. 6:33 But seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be added to you.


Well. Focus on God. Do what he says and every heart desire or thing you could ever want will be given to you if.


You Ask. Seek. Knock. Do it. Pray. Take action. Keep knocking til your door opens of opportunity and it shall be yours? Find the scripture.

Do the bible. Make it your past time to learn it. Faster, better you learn it the better your life becomes quicker.





Luke 17:20-21


The Coming of the Kingdom
20 Now when He was asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God would come, He answered them and said,
“The kingdom of God does not come with observation; 21 nor will they say, [a]‘See here!’ or ‘See there!’ For indeed, the kingdom of God is [b]within you.”



The Pharisees thought it be on earth. They were right but not like jesus thought.

All the happiness. Joy. Love and things you could ever desire.\

That cute women who is kinky and wants to do something with you without the stress in the relationship.
The cute bad boy who is kind and loving without being a player.

The ideal business or job.

Plenty of health and happy kids.


Do deliverance or biblical healing to attain this.
The fruit of the spirit is unlocked once you have done deliverance or biblical healing.


Please do it. Do it.

Whats the loss over a false doctrine of dogshit called.

Sensational Cessationism. Good at bum fuck nothing where you get nothing. NO rain. Half gospel half truth.

Miracles are the gold standard. This shit is sucks. Do cast your cares on god and you get a miracle.

They lie for $$$.
