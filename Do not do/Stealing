Pray about it - hebrews 11



Ill Gotten Gain = Stealing
Stealing is not a sin.




IT counts in favour and in trustworthiness in People's and God's Eyes.

You will lose 7 fold anything you steal.

Proverbs 6:30-31


People do not despise a thief
If he steals to satisfy himself when he is starving.
31 Yet when he is found, he must restore sevenfold;
He may have to give up all the substance of his house.
