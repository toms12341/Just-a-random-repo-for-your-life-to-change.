Hebrews 11/ Pray about it


Do not do.


Children. Do not curse your parents = Dishonour Curse/s.

Parents. DO not provoke your children to wrath to let an abuse spirit into your lives/household.


DO not disrespect people if you want to do your best to live in peace.


Do not ever fail to stand up for yourself when required and if you cannot.

Pray to God as taught in repo as Jesus Christ re-pays swiftly in judgement.


Do not do anything that is sin best of your ability to life in the blessings of Jesus Christ.
