Do you live for the appearance to make others to love you or do you do the work to live the life that makes you love you?


Many do not do live that life. 


If its great already but your internal world sucks you need biblical healing. Only way.


As your soul prospers so does your world prosper. Its a scripture cbf google it. Internal world changes before your external world does biblically.
