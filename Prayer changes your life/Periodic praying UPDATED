Hebrews 11 / Pray about it.


Peace to you from God our Father

Periodic praying 2 fold.

A) AMPLIFICATION PRAYER

I pray a pray on a skill like drawing but as I draw I gain an amplification of my skill of drawning.

In jesus I pray that My skill of drawing keeps getting better as i draw thank you jesus.

Keeps getting better and better. God will give liberally what is required.

B) AUTOMATIC RECURRDING PRAYER

Pray one prayer and it is never ending hitting when you need the prayer. WORKS WITH AUTOMATIC RECURRDING CURSING FOR PROTECTION ;) 

Like I prayed this pray on 1/1/2012 it manifested its answer from God on 12/1/2012 but continues to 
be made manifest its answer on 2/2/2012 and 12/1/2012 and continues on.

I pray i be protected from evil thank you jesus in your name.

Made manifest the answer on these dates

1/1/2012, 12/1/2012, 2/2/2012.

instead of repraying it over and over one prayer made manifest in the answer over and over. Nothing wrong with continuing to pray. 

God can be told or knows what type of pray You want it to be on classification. 


Jesus christ loves you and wants you to please him in seeking and praying. Enjoy your blessings and count them when times get hard. 

I am the inventor of this LOL. in my pride i accept that i am not perfect.
