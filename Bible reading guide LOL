Meditation on the word in pslam 1 is not the WELLNESS APP MEDITATION - Do no do WELLNESS APP MEDITATION its bad for your mind and lets in depression. 
Meditation on the word = Thinking on the word.
Condemnation = Guilt
lasciviousness = Nudity and Overly sexual Behaviour. Eg Man with no pants at a public beach.
Covetousness = Jeaously or comparision. 
Grounding = Witchcraft. Nothing wrong with barefeet on the ground but ask god.

WITCHCRAFT = CONTROL, DOMINATION AND MANIPULATION.
CONTROL = You cannot go to the park (With no legit reason)
DOMINATION = Yelling over you for no reason
MANIPULATION = Hey, Can you do this for me. 5 seconds later. Why did you do that? Are you stupid? I'll Do that for you? (Guilt tripping or gaslighting.)

SIN. OK SOME OF YOU DO NOT KNOW THIS BUT DO NOT DO THESE THINGS.

YOGA / PILATES AS IT GIVES LUST AND DEPRESSION DEMONS.
OTHER RELIGIONS.
OCCULT - Derek price video. I've been an occultist in kabbalah. I prayed witchcraft for strength and it gave me osteoarthritis. Asking Satan for bread when he gives a serpent. He will give it to you at a cost later. Kicks you down.
Jesus gives bread when asked for bread but then gives you 5 loaves of bread when you have asked for 1.

Satanism is not freedom. Do as thou wilt but they forgot to tell you REAP WHAT YOU SOW. (SOW SIN = DEATH = BONDS/CURSES FROM SATAN DUE TO YOUR CHOICES)
You cannot break spiritual rules of the game. Your life is hindered in Deuteronomy in which ways? Just LLM what you know the curses to be and do deliverance.

FOR HIGH RANKING DEMONS PRAY TO DEMOTE THEM TO LEVEL 4 (4-1 is the levels) to get your deliverannce easier.
