Now that you have received a break thru from the Holy Spirit it is important that you do not allow the spirits to steal what you have received from the Lord (Jn. 10:10).  You received a full or partial healing or a full or partial deliverance from spirits on your visit to the facility.  The demons will try to re-enter your body within 48 hours.  They usually use negativity from PEOPLE to set it up.  You can expect someone (family member, co-worker, stranger) to verbally attack you shortly.  You can expect something unusual to happen shortly.  IF the demons get you to doubt, receive unbelief, absorb an offense or engage in a sinful behavior they can steal your healing and re-infect your body or your brain.   You must be ready for the attack (I Pet. 5:8).  You must use your spiritual weapons to retain your blessings from God (II Cor. 10:4-5).  You must use the Word of God to biind the power of the spirits (Mt. 18:18) and smash their lies (Lk. 10:19, Rom. 16:20).  You must not take an offense from attacks from others (Jn. 16:1) or the spirits will steal the progress you have made.


To ward off the attacks and retain your blessings you must
 (1)  Speak out loud to the spirits and rebuke them sharply (Mt. 16:23, Lk. 4:8, Mt. 17:18, Mk. 1:25, 9:25, Lk. 4:35, 9:42).  

(2)  Speak in Tongues off and on all day long and include singing in Tongues.  This is the best way to draw in the Holy Spirit (I Cor. 14). 

 (3)  You must FINISH your deliverance or healing process.  Some people are healed instantly and some are healed gradually.  Do not give up.  You must keep going (Ex. 23:30, Dt. 7:22, Mk. 8:23-25).  

(4)  You cannot let the spirits back into your body.  You could get worse than you were before you started for (Lk. 11:24-26, II Pet. 2:21, Mt. 12:43-45). 
 (5)  Understand and believe that the Lord will see you thru and you will be totally healed and delivered, Period (Ps. 91:3-13, 94:22, 37:3-5, 24-25,  Heb. 13:5, Pro. 3:5-8).  

(6)  Stop saying negative things and repeating lies (Ps. 34:13, Eph. 4:31, Titus 3:2, I Pet. 3:10).  You must fight the good fight of faith (I Tim. 3:12). 
 
(7)  Never live by emotions or feelings.  They will give you false impressions and lead you into discouragement (II Cor. 5:7).  Trust and obey and donâ€™t trust you mind (Pro. 3:4-5, Ps. 37:1-8) When you do, you will be victorious (I Jn. 5:4, I Cor. 15:57).  Please come back to the Deliverance Center until you are completely delivered and/or healed. 

FORGIVE THEM AND CHECK TIDBITS.
