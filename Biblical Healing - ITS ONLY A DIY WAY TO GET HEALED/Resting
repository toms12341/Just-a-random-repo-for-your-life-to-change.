So.




You need to sleep and rest alot. Don't over push your boundaries of deliverance.

Eat well. Do minimal fasts.


Humble yourself in alternative ways per addiction doc.


If you are sleeping bad. Do not do deliverance but sometimes they will manifest.


If you cannot sleep cast out insominia demons or put on the bible, pray in tounges and read the bible.

Read proclaimations of sleeping ps.4
