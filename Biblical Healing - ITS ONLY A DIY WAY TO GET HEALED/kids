Hebrews 11 pray about it
Test the spirit 1 john 1.
Okay its not hard.


If your kid is 1 day before 13 kick out all demons and train them in the basics of forgiveness, praying and blessing etc.

Father and the wife sit the kid on a nice couch or comfy place.

Let the kid cry out the demons. Most times its this way.


Let the father kick out a majority of the demonds.

1 hour average to heal the kid fully max 2 hours.

Come out in jesus name
Whilst the wife either helps praise god, comfort the kid. 


Father has greater spiritual responsibility but the wife also has authority.



Parents who sin let demons into the children below 13.
