It changes your feelings. 
It changes your perception.
It changes appearance. 
It changes your social life and love for yourself and others.
It changes your personality and your kingdom of heaven which is within feels better. Luke 17:21


Do it. Its life changing. You will have the kingdom of heaven fighting for it and living / doing the bible with minimal sin.


You can have negative feelings but when its demonic its super overwhelming like a big weight on you like depression without a reason
