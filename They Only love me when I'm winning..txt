They Only love me when I'm winning.
I am rejected and despised.
They love me because of my outcomes not who I am?
Doesn't people's life every change?
When I choose everything to succeed and they talk to cut you down.
Geniuses of the crowd. I am the quite the poet.
I failed and got to where i was because of failure curses.

I hate the average its mediocre. Trash.
I choose the trades 2 live the life I want to. I hate this the most.
Trying is better than most because most people do not. What are you missing on your path?
failure is temporary.

I got here today just. I'm a loser?

They wonder and dream about the life they could have cutting others down never trying. 
Why tell them your goals?
They go 5 years later and ponder why life still sucks when they didn't work for it?
At least have a go because the program of life is dogshit. Perplexity.ai it. Look at obesity rates and having abs is i think top 1%?

What do you choose?
Reap good doing the bible and your life gets better everytime.


The simple. What they told you to be. Where are you going on your path?
Negative tounges shall fade away.
